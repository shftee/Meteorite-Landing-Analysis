Project: Space Weather Analysis

Objectives:
Analyze trends and patterns in solar activity.
Study the frequency and intensity of solar flares and geomagnetic storms.
Understand the impacts of space weather on Earth, particularly on satellite communications and power grids.

Data Collection:

Source data from NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center or NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory.
Look for datasets that include information on solar flares, sunspots, geomagnetic storms, and other space weather phenomena.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Ensure timestamps are standardized for temporal analysis.
Exploratory Analysis:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics for solar activity indicators (e.g., number of sunspots, flare intensity).
Temporal Trends:
Plot time series data to observe trends in solar activity over months, years, and solar cycles.
Identify any seasonal or periodic patterns in solar flares and geomagnetic storms.
Event Analysis:
Create histograms and density plots for the intensity and frequency of solar flares and geomagnetic storms.
Use scatter plots to examine relationships between different space weather indicators.
Impact Analysis:

Study the correlation between space weather events and their impacts on Earth.
Analyze how solar storms affect satellite communications, power grids, and other technologies.
Geospatial Analysis:

Map the geographic distribution of geomagnetic storm impacts.
Identify regions more susceptible to space weather disturbances.
Reporting:

Document your findings with visualizations and narratives.
Create a comprehensive report or a Jupyter Notebook detailing your analysis process and insights.
Optionally, create an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to present your findings dynamically.
Tools and Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), or R (ggplot2, dplyr, Leaflet for mapping).
Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, or interactive Python libraries (Plotly, Altair).
Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting and presenting your analysis.
